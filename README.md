## Fagiolo Clustering Coefficients

This tool implements the clustering coefficients for directed networks as defined by:

> **Fagiolo, G.** (2007). *Clustering in complex directed networks*. Physical Review E, 76(2), 026107.

### The Five Coefficients

1. **Overall (C^D)**: General directed clustering considering all triangle types
   ```
   C^D_i = (A + A^T)^3_ii / [2(d^tot_i(d^tot_i - 1) - 2d^↔_i)]
   ```

2. **Cycle (C^cyc)**: Cyclical triangles (i → j → h → i)
   ```
   C^cyc_i = (A^3)_ii / (d^in_i × d^out_i - d^↔_i)
   ```

3. **Middleman (C^mid)**: Node acts as intermediary
   ```
   C^mid_i = (A×A^T×A)_ii / (d^in_i × d^out_i - d^↔_i)
   ```

4. **In (C^in)**: In-link pattern clustering
   ```
   C^in_i = (A^T×A^2)_ii / (d^in_i × (d^in_i - 1))
   ```

5. **Out (C^out)**: Out-link pattern clustering
   ```
   C^out_i = (A^2×A^T)_ii / (d^out_i × (d^out_i - 1))
   ```

where:
- A is the adjacency matrix
- d^in_i and d^out_i are in-degree and out-degree
- d^tot_i = d^in_i + d^out_i (total degree)
- d^↔_i is the number of bilateral (reciprocal) edges

## Small-Worldness

The tool computes the small-worldness coefficient:

```
σ = (C / C_random) / (L / L_random)
```

where:
- C = clustering coefficient of the original graph
- C_random = average clustering of random graphs
- L = average path length of the original graph  
- L_random = average path length of random graphs

**Interpretation:**
- σ > 1: Graph exhibits small-world properties
- σ ≤ 1: Graph does not exhibit small-world properties

Random graphs are generated with the same degree sequence as the original graph using the configuration model.

## Performance Optimization

The tool uses several optimizations for large graphs:

- **Sparse matrix operations** (CSR format) instead of dense arrays
- **Vectorized computations** for all nodes simultaneously
- **Pre-computed matrix powers** (A², A³) to avoid redundant calculations
- **Single-pass algorithm** for all clustering coefficients
- **Memory-efficient** bilateral edge computation

**Typical performance:**
- 100 nodes, 500 edges: < 1 second
- 1,000 nodes, 5,000 edges: ~5 seconds
- 5,000 nodes, 25,000 edges: ~30 seconds

## Use Cases

- **Software Architecture Analysis**: Analyze code dependency graphs
- **Social Network Analysis**: Study directed social relationships
- **Citation Networks**: Analyze paper citation patterns
- **Web Structure**: Study hyperlink networks
- **Biological Networks**: Gene regulatory networks, metabolic pathways
- **Infrastructure Networks**: Traffic flow, communication networks

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: Input file not found"
- Check that the file path is correct
- Ensure the file has .dot or .gv extension

### Memory errors on large graphs
- Reduce `--random-iterations` to 5 or fewer
- The tool uses sparse matrices, but very large graphs (>50k nodes) may still require significant RAM

### "sigma is nan"
- This can occur if the graph is disconnected with no large strongly connected component
- The average path length may be infinite in such cases
